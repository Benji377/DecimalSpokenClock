# DecimalSpokenClock

## Idea
It all started when I was bored and started thinking about what could happen 1 minute had 100 seconds instead of 60 and if 1 hour had 100 minutes.
I therefore started creating my own clock with those parameters, but I also wanted to make it somehow useful. I therefore tried to create an
converter for it, but that's where I failed at. The clock wasn't reliable and therefore completely useless.

## The upgrade
After failing my initial idea, I proceeded with the second one. I had a free hosting slot available anyway and wanted to use it. I redesigned the clock to be the actual normal time, but displayed in words instead of numbers. I then also gave it the option to talk and played a bit with the colors. The clock then got published online for everyone to use.

## The end
In the end I got in trouble with the hosting service for using too much Javascript calls. The issue was that I had written almost everything in Javascript and every visitor was calling it every second. This resulted in big memory loads and I had to take it down. But I think someone might find it interesting or useful, so here it is.
